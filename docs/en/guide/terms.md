# Subscription Service Agreement

This agreement is considered a supplementary agreement to the "Membership Service Agreement" and is an integral part of it, forming a unified whole. If there is a conflict between this agreement and the "Membership Service Agreement", this agreement shall prevail. If you need to use the VIP auto-renewal service, you must agree to this agreement.

You understand and agree:

1. Service Name: Auto-renewal.

2. This service is an auto-renewal service provided to you on the premise that you have already subscribed to the VIP service. If you subscribe to the VIP service, you are deemed to have authorized VIP to deduct the next billing cycle's monthly fee from your iTunes account (hereinafter referred to as "account") balance when your VIP service is about to expire. The realization of this service is premised on the successful deduction from the aforementioned account. You shall bear the responsibility for renewal failure due to an insufficient deductible balance in the said account.

There are two subscription options for VIP:

- 1 month, auto-renews every 1 month
- 12 months, auto-renews every 12 months

3. The account that purchases the auto-renewing VIP will be automatically renewed and the corresponding fee will be deducted 24 hours before expiration. If you have subscribed to a 1-month VIP auto-renewal and then subscribe to a 12-month VIP auto-renewal in the same month, the fee will be automatically deducted from the account before the service expires and the VIP validity period will be extended by 12 months.

4. If you need to cancel the auto-renewal, please do so at least 24 hours in advance. You can suspend or terminate this service in the following ways:

- Unsubscribe Method 1: In the App, cancel the VIP subscription in "Manage My Subscriptions".

- Unsubscribe Method 2: For users who auto-renew with Apple's in-app payment (IAP), the unsubscription method is as follows: Open the Apple phone "Settings" -> go to "iTunes Store and App Store" -> click "Apple ID", select "View Apple ID", enter the "Account Settings" page, click "Subscriptions", and select VIP to cancel the subscription.

5. The same Apple ID can only enable the auto-renewal service for one account.
