# Getting Started

## Core Workflow

PasteQ is designed to minimize mouse interaction and the need to memorize hotkeys, letting you focus on your current task.

### Summoning and Hiding

- **Global Hotkey**: Press `Option + c` (default) to summon PasteQ's main window from anywhere.
- **Auto-hide**: PasteQ automatically hides when you complete an action or switch to another window. You can also press the global hotkey again to hide it.

> **Tip**: You can customize the global hotkey in the app's settings to fit your preferences.

### Browsing and Searching

- **Arrow Keys**: Use `↑` and `↓` to browse through your clipboard history.
- **Filter by Category**:
    - Use `Command + ←` and `Command + →` to select different record categories (e.g., text, images, links).
- **Search**: Simply start typing to search your clipboard history in real-time.

### Copying and Pasting

- **Direct Paste**: Select a record and press `Enter`. PasteQ will automatically hide and paste the record into your current active window (this can be toggled in settings).

### More Operations

> Due to space limitations, not all features are listed here.

- **Automatic Hotkey Hints**: The bottom bar automatically shows the currently available actions and their hotkeys.
- **Settings**: In the Settings, you can explore more feature toggles.

## Managing Your Clipboard

### Pinning and Grouping

For frequently used information like code snippets, email addresses, or common phrases, you can pin them for quick access.

- **Pin**: Select a record and press `Command + P` to pin it to the Pin group.
- **Group Management**: You can also add your own custom-named groups and manage them (create/edit/delete) in the settings.

## Privacy and Security

We understand the importance of data security, and PasteQ provides robust protection for your privacy.

- **Private Content Recognition**: The app can automatically recognize potential private information (like phone numbers, emails, etc.) in your clipboard content offline and encrypt it.
- **Local Encryption**: All encrypted clipboard data is stored in an encrypted format on your local disk, ensuring the security of your local data.
- **iCloud Sync**: You can choose to enable iCloud Sync to securely sync your data across your Mac devices.
